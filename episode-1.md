### **Resources**
- [Front End Developer Handbook](https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/2019/)
    - This is a great place for general high-level knowledge about everything related to web development. I highly recommend sections on web/browsers and HTTP.

- [Version Control (Git)](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
    - This is required reading for any new developer. Being comfortable with version control is a prerequisite to getting a job in the industry.
